My name is Ivan Rodriguez. I am a college student by day, and I am a coder and an activist by night.
I believe that technology can be used for the betterment of society and not for the betterment of the top 1%.
For the past few months as an activist, I have written articles on Medium that have inspired many people, and thanks to my writing, I have at least 25 followers on Medium.
I also am the creator of the NimbleUI library, a library for developing efficient user interfaces, and I am the PMC Chair of the NimbleUI Community.

This is my personal blog where I have more freedom to discuss more technical or more opinionated than what I would write on Medium. I hope you enjoy my blog posts, and I would like to thank you for stopping by.

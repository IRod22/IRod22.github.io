# Why Japanese Is Both Easy and Hard to Learn

My experience with learning Japanese.

---

Japanese is an interesting language to say the least;
some people say the language is hard, yet others say the language is easier than a few other languages.
In this post, I will explain why Japanese can be both hard yet easy to learn.

## Before we begin

I feel like I need to bring up some terminology before we dive further into this post. Here is the terminology that I feel that needs to be cleared up:
1. A **syllabary** defines the syllables, of a language, an alphabet, or a script (ex. Cyrillic); in other words, a syllabary defines how words in a language are pronounced.
2. **Kanji** is a Japanese script that uses Chinese characters in Japanese writing; the Japanese writing system uses two other scripts as well as Kanji. 
3. **Hiragana** and **Katakana** are the two other scripts that were made by Japanese people; these scripts represent the Japanese Syllabary.
